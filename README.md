# RP Brain Heterogeneity Analysis
Ribosomal Protein Heterogeneity in Brain Cell Types
Description
Analysis of cell type-specific ribosomal protein expression patterns across brain regions, focusing on Rps24 expression in health and disease conditions. Our analysis reveals distinct patterns of ribosomal protein expression across neural cell types and identifies S24-PKE as a novel marker for neuroinflammation.

Data Sources
The analysis uses three main datasets:

Cell type-specific RiboTag data from astrocytes and microglia
Neuronal RiboTag data from Bauer et al. (2023)
Neuroinflammation RiboTag data from Kang et al. (2018)
Analysis Scripts
glia_rp_analysis.R: Analysis of astrocyte and microglia RiboTag data
neuron_rp_analysis.R: Reanalysis of published neuronal RiboTag data
neuroinflammation_rp_analysis.R: Analysis of disease and inflammation conditions
Dependencies
R packages required:

tidyverse
ggplot2
biomaRt
pheatmap
